## Problem
In FMAT it has been observed that students tend to wait too long for their food, this causing an affectation in the schedules, since the free moments are short, in consecuence, they don´t allow the opportunity to be able to spend so much time when waiting. This is why the initiative arises to inquire about this problem, and find out the reason for the situation; we as a team, decided to address it from the root, in order to provide help for the benefit of both sides. 

Based on the above, we opted to contact the cafeteria staff and schedule a talk, where several topics were addressed, one of them being the most important and the cause, was the "efficiency in communication" because they told us that their channel (this being having to raise their voice) prevented them from being faster when ordering, for this reason, they intend to adopt new strategies to provide a better service.
